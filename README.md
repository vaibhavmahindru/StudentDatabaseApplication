# Student Database Application

## A simple app to manage student enrollments and their balance.

It performs the following functions:-

- Ask the user how many new students would be added each time.
- User will enter the name and the year for each student.
- Each and every student will have a unique 5 digit ID with first number being there year.
- Student will enroll in the given courses.
- Each course will cost differently or same.
- The student would be able to view their balance and pay their tution fees.
- Student would see the following things in their details:-
  - Name
  - ID
  - Courses Enrolled
  - Balance

## I have not called the account method in the code anywhere.
